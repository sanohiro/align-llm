# Align language/stdlib requests from align-llm

This document records capabilities that the **Align language and standard library** need,
discovered by building `align-llm` (a local LLM coding system) as a real client. It is the
register that `AGENTS.md` requires ("If this project needs missing Align functionality, document
the dependency clearly").

**How to use this document.** `align-llm` is a *driver*: its purpose is to surface genuine Align
needs, not to force-build around them. Each request below is meant to be implemented **in the
Align repository** (`../align`), in Align's own design discipline (author a design spec under
`docs/impl/std-design/`, then implement + test), and can be handed directly to Align's own tooling.
`align-llm` does not work around these; it waits for the Align capability and then exercises it as a
real client.

Verified against the `../align` compiler on 2026-07-24. File paths are stable references; line
numbers are approximate and may drift — locate by function name.

## Request 1 — `std.process`: child output capture (+ working directory, environment, timeout)

**Priority: critical.** This blocks the core of `align-llm`'s verification loop.

### Motivation

`align-llm`'s central job is to run build/test/lint commands (`git`, `make check`, a test runner)
and **parse their output** to extract structured errors, summarize failures, and generate repair
prompts. Reading a child process's `stdout`/`stderr` as strings is therefore fundamental, not
optional.

### Current state in Align

`std.process` (design: `docs/impl/std-design/process.md`, status "complete in M11") provides:

```text
process.spawn(cmd: str, args: array<str>) -> Result<child, Error>   // fork + execvp
child.wait() -> Result<i64, Error>                                   // reap, return exit code only
child.kill(sig: i64) -> Result<(), Error>
process.exec / exit / abort / cpu_count
```

The runtime (`crates/align_runtime/src/lib.rs`, `align_rt_process_spawn`) does a bare `fork` +
`execvp`: it installs **no pipes and no `dup2`**, so the child inherits the parent's file
descriptors and its output goes straight to the terminal. The `Child` handle is only
`{ pid: i32, reaped: bool }`. Consequently:

- **Capturing `stdout`/`stderr` as strings: not possible.** No `process.output` / `process.run`
  surface exists.
- **Working directory (`cwd`): not possible.** `spawn` has no `cwd` argument; there is no
  `chdir` / `set_cwd` anywhere in `std`.
- **Per-child environment: not possible.** The child inherits the parent environment only.
- **Timeout: not possible.** `wait()` blocks indefinitely; there is no `try_wait` equivalent.

Notably, output capture / `cwd` / timeout are **not present in `process.md`'s design space** — the
only recorded deferrals there are `detach()` and a `Never` type. So this is a genuinely new,
real-workload-motivated requirement, not a planned gap.

### Requested capability

A way to run a child process and collect its captured output, working directory, environment, and a
timeout. A single high-level call fits the workload well; the exact surface is Align's design
decision. A sketch consistent with the existing idioms (Move handles, `Result`, *Nothing hidden*):

```text
// One-shot run with captured output. All non-cmd/argv fields optional.
process.run(cmd: str, args: array<str>, opts?) -> Result<output, Error>
  where output = { code: i64, stdout: string, stderr: string }   // or a merged stream option
        opts   = { cwd?: str, env?: <name,value pairs>, timeout_ns?: i64 }
```

Alternatively, extend the existing `spawn`/`child` model with explicit stream redirection
(pipe + `dup2`), a `cwd`/`env` on spawn, and a `wait_timeout(ns)` — whichever composes better with
Align's stream (`reader`/`writer`) design. Output capture and `cwd` are the two must-haves; `env`
and `timeout` are strongly wanted (a hung test currently freezes the whole loop).

### Design considerations

- *Nothing hidden*: captured output must be an explicit, owned value the caller reads — no hidden
  process-wide buffer. Fits the existing "buffered-writer output is never silently lost" stance.
- UTF-8: build/test output may not be valid UTF-8. Either validate and error (consistent with
  `fs.read_file`), or offer a bytes-returning tier alongside the `string` tier (mirroring
  `read_file` vs `read_bytes_view`). A bytes tier is safer for arbitrary tool output.
- Timeout semantics: on expiry, `SIGKILL` the child and surface a distinct `Error` variant so the
  caller can tell "timed out" from "exited nonzero".

### Acceptance / gate

Spawn a command that writes to both `stdout` and `stderr` and exits nonzero; the caller recovers the
full `stdout` string, the full `stderr` string, and the exit code. Running a command in a specified
`cwd` observes that directory. A command that exceeds `timeout_ns` is killed and reported as a
timeout rather than blocking.

## Request 2 — `std.http` / `std.net`: I/O timeouts

**Priority: high.** Needed for reliable LLM API calls.

### Motivation

`align-llm` calls OpenAI-/Anthropic-compatible HTTPS endpoints (`POST /v1/chat/completions`). A
model endpoint can hang or black-hole a connection. Without a timeout, the coding loop can stall
indefinitely on a single request, which is unacceptable for an automated verify/repair loop.

### Current state in Align

`std.http` is otherwise sufficient for the client: `http.client()`, `http.request("POST", url)` with
`r.header(name, value)` and `r.body(...)`, `cl.request(req)`, HTTPS via the system trust store,
response `status()`/`header()`/`body()`. **But there is no timeout on connect, read, or write.** The
runtime records this explicitly:

- `crates/align_runtime/src/lib.rs` — "sets no connect timeout (a hung/black-holed peer blocks
  indefinitely)" and "I/O timeouts stay a net-rail follow-up".

So unlike Request 1, this is **already an acknowledged deferred item in Align**. `align-llm` simply
provides the concrete client demand that justifies pulling it forward.

### Requested capability

Configurable connect/read/write (or overall-deadline) timeouts on the HTTP client and/or the
underlying `std.net` sockets. Surface is Align's choice; a per-client default plus a per-request
override is the common shape. A transport timeout should surface as an `Error` (consistent with
"transport/TLS/malformed-message failures are errors; an HTTP status is data").

### Acceptance / gate

A request to an endpoint that accepts the connection but never responds returns an `Err` (timeout)
within the configured bound instead of blocking indefinitely.

## Not requested (respecting Align's design)

These were considered and deliberately **not** requested, because they conflict with Align's design
or are already implemented:

- **A dynamic "JSON value" type.** Align deliberately requires declared record types and has no
  expression-position type arguments. `std.json` already decodes nested structs, `array<Struct>`,
  `Option<T>` (missing key / `null` → `None`), enums (shape-directed unions), and ignores unknown
  fields — verified against `examples/json_nested.align`, which decodes an OpenAI chat-completions
  shape. `align-llm` should declare provider response structs, not ask Align for a dynamic value
  type. (Caveat handled app-side: decoded `str` fields are zero-copy views into the input; use
  `.clone()` to persist them past the input's lifetime.)
- **Working directory via app-side shell.** A `sh -c "cd <dir> && ..."` workaround exists, but it is
  fragile (shell quoting, no native exit/stream semantics); native `cwd` is requested in Request 1
  instead of relying on it.
